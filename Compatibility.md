The next version of DataNucleus (4.0) is now starting, and <b>there are no plans to update this plugin to work with v4.0 of DataNucleus</b>. If you require that, you need to request that upgrade from Google (and maybe at the same time ask why 3.0 of this plugin is still unreleased a year after being written, and why v1.x of this plugin is still seemingly the default provided by GAE SDK).
